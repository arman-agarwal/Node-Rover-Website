## Node Rover

## Uploading and getting started

Download and keep all required files in a folder named `nodeRover`

Download the latest Arduino IDE

Install all packages required for ESP32

Open the ino file and connect your esp32 to your computer

Make sure the correct port number is selected and the arduino detects the esp32

Set the BAUD rate to 9600

Set the credentials of the wifi network in secrets.hpp file

Turn on the node rover and upload the code

Open the serial monitor once the code finishes uploading

You should see the esp32 trying to connect to a network and printing out an IP address once it connects

Open the node-rover-website code and add the IP address there.

Navigate to the node-rover-website folder

run npm install to install all necessary packages

run the command npm run dev to run the website

You should get a local website on the terminal (probably localhost:3000)

Open this link on your browser.

You can control the node-rover using the website

Hooray
